# Cyber risk indicator

## About

This webapp was developed during the course of the FHNW IP5 Project "Cyber risk indicator".
It serves as a prototype of concepts described in the corresponding thesis.
It's goal is to motivate SME owners and employees to improve their cybersecurity and it's supposed to function as a landing page for the GEIGER Toolbox.

## Abstract

This paper tries to get to the bottom of how and in what way we can use nudges to motivate people from different
motivational levels to inform themselves about cybersecurity.

Our work aims to integrate nudges into website variants designed for users of varying motivational levels. These website
variants serve, not only to inform visitors about current cyber security topics, but also as “landing and download page”
for the GEIGER Toolbox. We conduct user tests to investigate the impact of nudges on our users and more specifically
we also explore the option of nudging via risk indication.

We created a questionnaire to determine the motivation level of end users concerning cyber security based on existing
research papers about motivation level determination. The results of that questionnaire allow us to apply ethical nudges
that stimulate people's motivation and respond to their pyschological needs.

Our user tests have shown that nudges can influence people, if applied correctly. However, this influence was the same
across all motivation levels, at least for the motivation levels we investigated. Our tests have also shown that the
indicated risk has one of biggest impacts out of all the nudges.

The discussion covers our plans, results, and recommendations to encourage further research on this topic
